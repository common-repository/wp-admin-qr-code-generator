An extremely simple plugin that adds a QR code to pages/posts edit screen to save you time when you develop for mobiles.

== Description ==

Are you developing for mobile devices? Then this plugin is for you!

How annoying is it to type the long and complex URL of a development site on your small mobile's keyboard? I got tired of it and came out with this plugin.

The plugin will add a new metabox in the page/post edit screen, and another one on the admin dashboard. For pages/posts, a QR code will be dynamically generated, pointing to the page's URL. No need to manually type the URL, just scann the QR code!

On the WordPress dashboard, another QR code will take you directly to the site's homepage after you scanned it with your mobile. All QR codes are dynamically generated through the Google Chart API.

The plugin is extremely simple, it doesn't do anything else than adding the QR Code metabox to posts. No calls to database, no extra information added to your site! Just a faster way to preview your pages on mobile devices.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `wp-admin-qr-code` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Scan the QR code on your pages / posts edit screen

The plugin can easily support custom post types. To add more post types, use the filter 'wpaqr_post_types' (see FAQ for more details).
